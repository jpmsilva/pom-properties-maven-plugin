POM Properties Maven Plugin

  The POM Properties Maven Plugin allows any project to import properties defined in dependencies.
  Typically this can be used to import properties defined in Bill Of Material (BOM) projects, such as the org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-dependencies
  project.
  Importing these BOM dependencies only brings it's dependency management sections. Referencing properties defined in these dependencies on your own project
  can be very useful.

* Goals Overview

  The POM Properties Maven Plugin as a single goal:

  * {{{./read-dependency-pom-mojo.html}pom-properties:read-dependency-pom}} import from specified dependencies.

* Usage
